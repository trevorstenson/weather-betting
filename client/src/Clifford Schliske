Occupation: Pilot who transports dogs for adoption by the uber-rich.

Operate my own one man company called Big Red Dog Departures that provides a tailored dog adoption service for wealthy people.
Applicants submit what they're looking for and I procure the specimen if I can find a suitable match.

One year ago I was flying a Border Collie named Casper from Lansing, Michigan to Philadelphia for a client named Solomon Guggenheim.
Half of the flight took place in darkness as I was trying to finish the job so I could get back home for something.
Somewhere over Lake Erie, things began to get eerie. I heard a low wailing noise from the back of the plane that kept repeating.
I tried to check what was going on, but as soon as I turned around and moved my vision went completely white.
All I could hear were two voices discussing how they were going to make this look like an accident. What they were talking about? I didn't know.
I was forced to assume the worst. The disembodied and distant, yet ever close, voices were talking about how they were going to kill me. I could barely hear myself scream.
This continued for what felt like an hour until I could no longer tell if I was even conscious.

I woke up on the beach in tattered clothing with no dog or aircraft in sight.
Ever since, I have been trying to figure out what happened to me that fateful night.
I explored electroshock therapy, seances, chess therapy, ventriloquism, and even reached out to my nemesis and business competitor, Kermit Crankovitch, to see if this had happened to him.
He directed me to Desiree Washington.
To this day, I will never fly another dog named Casper again.
I am also banned from all future museums created by Solomon Guggenheim.
